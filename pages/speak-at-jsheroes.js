        <h2>Call for Papers is closed!</h2>
        <p>
          Our <strong>Call for Papers</strong> process is now closed.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you submitted a talk will get back to you as soon as the JSHeroes team has gone through
          all of them.

        <p>
          We will do our best to build an <strong>agenda</strong> that covers{' '}
          <strong>diverse</strong> topics which can be of interest for the majority of attendees
          interested in the current landscape of the JavaScript world. We do not wish to limit your
          perspectives, but we did propose a couple of <strong>broad topics</strong> in the CFP
          form, in which your proposal may fall. However, do not consider them restrictive, but
          rather see them as a guideline to classify and structure all the proposals we receive.

          How the selection will happen
        </h3>
        <p>
          We hace received more than <strong>300 proposals</strong> for JSHeroes 2019. We created a
          team of world wide subject matter experts that will go through the proposals and will
          decide what to include in the conference agenda. This is a rough estimation of our
          schedule and process:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All the proposals are to be received until <strong>December 1st</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each member of the commitee will go through the proposals and will create their own{' '}
            <strong>shortlist</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Based on the recurrence of a proposal on multiple shortlists we will proceed to place it
            on the <strong>accepted</strong> list.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <strong>debate</strong> and <strong>selection</strong> process for the remaining
            proposals will end around <strong>mid January</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            All the speakers will get a <strong>response</strong>, positive or negative, until the{' '}
            <strong>end of January</strong>, at most until mid February.
          </li>
          <li>
            At the end of the process we will publish the exact <strong>criteria</strong> on which
            we based our selection.
          </li>
        </ul>
